          <h1>WHO IAM</h1>
          <P><b>Iam a web designer and, I also develop it and I like it soo much.</b><br>
            Since I was a child I loved things to do with computer and technologies more so platforms used to convey informations
            and messages. I was obsessed with facebook,whatsap and google then as the time goes I decided to venture on what is
            going on at the background and to know the origin of it. That's how I decided to do web design and developement to helpthose
            who want to convey there information through various Internet come through.</P>

            <div class="con-132"><p>From a very young age I liked to draw, cut out, make collages and tell stories. I never had my
              feet on the ground. I tore up a lot of magazines and painted books that I shouldn't have.
              Mom said she was going to work in advertising. He was somewhat right...</p>

              <p>I studied Computer science and specialized in programming(web design and front-end development and I realise I can combine everything I like;
              Coding, comics, drawing, games and storytelling, all in one.
                I am still in Laikipia University taking course in computer science.</p>

            <p> In all my works I put something of myself, something I saw,
            something I read, heard or played. I build visual stories
              that cross space and conquer the confines of the universe, reaching chromatic galaxies and typographic planets.</p>
